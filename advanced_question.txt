🔁 1. What is the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB? How does it differ from find()?
Aggregation is used to process large amounts of data and return computed results.
 It uses a pipeline concept (like UNIX pipes), allowing you to transform and combine data.

find() is for querying documents.

aggregate() is used for operations like $group, $sum, $avg, $project.
